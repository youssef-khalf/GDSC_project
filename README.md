Brain Tumor Classifier
The Brain Tumor Classifier is a simple GUI application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to predict whether a person has a brain tumor or not by uploading an MRI image. The underlying machine learning model is based on the ResNet50 architecture and has been trained to classify brain tumor images.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a straightforward user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the system.

Image Upload: Users can upload MRI images of the brain using the "Browse" button.

Real-Time Prediction: The application performs real-time predictions using a pre-trained machine learning model.

Prediction Result: The result of the prediction is displayed on the interface, indicating whether the person is normal or has a brain tumor.
